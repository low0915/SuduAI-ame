                <h2 class="text-lg font-bold text-sudu-main mt-8 mb-4">1. Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    This Cancellation, Refund, and Service Delivery Policy (“Policy”) outlines the terms governing
                    cancellations, refunds, and delivery of the SuDu AI Manufacturing Execution System (MES) and
                    Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software services (“Services”), offered by A Serious AI Sdn Bhd
                    through <a href="https://www.sudu.ai/" class="text-sudu-sec font-medium">www.sudu.ai</a>. The
                    Services are provided as Software as a Service (SaaS) subscriptions in Lite, Basic, Standard, and
                    Enterprise tiers, or as customizations tailored to specific customer requirements. This Policy
                    forms part of our Terms and Conditions and applies to all users of the Services. By using the
                    Services, you agree to this Policy.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-lg font-bold text-sudu-main mt-8 mb-4">2. Cancellation</h2>
                <p>You may cancel your access to the SuDu AI Services under the following conditions:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-4">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Cancellation During Trial Period:</strong> A 7-day trial period is offered for SaaS
                        subscriptions (typically Lite or Basic tier). You may cancel your trial at any time within
                        these 7 days without charge by emailing <a href="mailto:hi@aserious.co"
                            class="text-sudu-sec">hi@aserious.co</a>.
                        Cancellation requests must be submitted before the trial ends to avoid charges for a
                        subscription.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Cancellation of SaaS Subscriptions:</strong> After the trial period, you may cancel
                        your SaaS subscription (Lite, Basic, Standard, or Enterprise tier) by providing 30 days’
                        written notice to <a href="mailto:hi@aserious.co" class="text-sudu-sec">hi@aserious.co</a>.
                        No cancellations due to change of mind will be accepted after the trial period without the
                        required notice.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Cancellation of Customizations:</strong> Customizations, including tailored
                        configurations or bespoke implementations, are non-cancelable after the agreement is signed,
                        due to the bespoke nature of the Services. You may cease using the customized Services at your
                        discretion, but no cancellations are permitted post-agreement.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Cancellation Requests:</strong> All cancellation requests must be submitted via email
                        to <a href="mailto:hi@aserious.co" class="text-sudu-sec">hi@aserious.co</a>. We reserve the
                        right to reject cancellation requests deemed unfit or unreasonable, such as those violating
                        our Terms and Conditions.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-lg font-bold text-sudu-main mt-8 mb-4">3. Refund Policy</h2>
                <p>
                    A Serious AI Sdn Bhd does not offer refunds for SaaS subscriptions or customizations, including
                    for partial or unused terms, regardless of circumstances, except where explicitly required by
                    Malaysian consumer protection laws (e.g., non-delivery of Services). To evaluate the Services,
                    please use the 7-day trial period for SaaS subscriptions before purchasing. Any legally mandated
                    refunds will be processed via the original payment method (bank transfer or credit/debit card)
                    within 3–5 business days, subject to verification. Refund requests must be submitted to
                    <a href="mailto:hi@aserious.co" class="text-sudu-sec">hi@aserious.co</a>.
                </p>
